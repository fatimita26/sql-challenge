# sql-challenge

In this challenge I was able to create a Data base Diagram using quickdatabaseediagrams.com. I created the tables, name all columns with their data type, create and assign primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

This was exported to PostgreSQL. I locally created the tables, upload the data and was able to run some queries for data analysis

SQL is a great tool :)
